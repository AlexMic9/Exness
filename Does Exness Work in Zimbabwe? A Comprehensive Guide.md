## Regulatory Status in Zimbabwe

One of the primary concerns for traders is the safety and legality of a broker. In Zimbabwe, the financial sector is overseen by the **Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ)**, which regulates monetary policy and financial institutions. However, the RBZ does not directly regulate online forex brokers like Exness, as forex trading operates in a somewhat grey area in the country.

Exness is not registered or licensed by the RBZ, but this is not a barrier to its operations. Instead, Exness holds licenses from several reputable international regulatory bodies, including:

- **Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC)**
- **Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)** in the UK
- **Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA)** in South Africa
- **Financial Services Authority (FSA)** in Seychelles

These licenses ensure that Exness adheres to strict international standards for transparency, client fund protection, and operational integrity. For Zimbabwean traders, this means that while Exness is not locally regulated, it operates under robust global regulations, providing a secure trading environment.

Zimbabwean traders should, however, remain mindful of local laws, such as foreign exchange controls and tax obligations, to ensure compliance when trading with Exness.
