- **Phone Verification**: Enter your phone number with the Ghana country code (+233). Choose to receive a code via SMS or a phone call, then enter the 6-digit code and click ‚ÄúContinue.‚Äù

### Step 4: Complete the Economic Profile
The Economic Profile is a short survey about your trading experience and financial background. This step is mandatory for verification:
- Answer questions about your source of income, profession, and trading experience.
- Ensure your responses are accurate, as they help Exness assess your suitability for trading.

### Step 5: Upload Proof of Identity (POI)
To verify your identity:
- In the ‚ÄúVerify Account‚Äù section, select the country of issue for your ID (Ghana).
- Choose the ID type (e.g., passport, national ID card, or driver‚Äôs license).

### Step 6: Upload Proof of Residence (POR)
To verify your address:
- Upload a recent document (issued within the last three to six months) showing your full name and residential address in Ghana.

- Ensure the document is clear, legible, and not cropped. Avoid using filters or editing tools that may alter its authenticity.
- Click ‚ÄúNext‚Äù to submit.

### Step 7: Wait for Verification
After submitting your documents:
- Exness typically reviews documents within 24-48 hours, though feedback on Proof of Identity or Residence may be provided within minutes for straightforward cases.
- Check your Personal Area or email for updates on your verification status.
- If your documents are rejected, Exness will notify you with reasons (e.g., low image quality, expired documents, or mismatched information). You can re-upload corrected documents as needed.

### Step 8: Confirm Full Verification
Once both your POI and POR documents are approved:
- Log in to your Personal Area to confirm your account is fully verified.
- All deposit and withdrawal limits will be lifted, and you‚Äôll gain access to advanced features and payment methods, such as Mobile Money in Ghana.

## Tips for a Smooth Verification Process

To avoid delays or rejections during verification, follow these best practices:
