## What is a Cent Account?

A **Cent Account** is a type of trading account designed for beginners or traders who want to practice with minimal financial risk. Unlike standard accounts, where balances are denominated in dollars or other major currencies, a Cent Account uses **cents** as the base unit. For example, if you deposit $10 into a Cent Account, your balance will appear as **1,000 cents**. This allows traders to execute smaller trades, making it an excellent option for learning and testing strategies.

Exness, a globally recognized forex broker, offers the **Standard Cent Account**, which is tailored for novice traders. The account operates similarly to a standard account but with reduced trade sizes, lower risk, and a smaller minimum deposit requirement. It’s a bridge between demo accounts (which use virtual funds) and real accounts, offering a live trading environment with minimal financial exposure.

### Key Characteristics of a Cent Account
- **Micro Lot Trading**: Trades are executed in **cent lots** (e.g., 1 cent lot = 100,000 cents or 1,000 USD), allowing for smaller position sizes.
- **Low Minimum Deposit**: Typically, you can start with as little as $1, making it accessible for beginners.
- **Real Market Conditions**: Unlike demo accounts, Cent Accounts expose you to live market fluctuations, providing practical experience.
- **Reduced Risk**: Smaller trade sizes mean lower financial risk, ideal for testing strategies or learning the ropes.

By using a Cent Account, traders can gain confidence, refine their skills, and understand market dynamics without the pressure of significant losses.
