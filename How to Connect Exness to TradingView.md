Follow these steps to integrate your Exness account with TradingView:

### Step 1: Log in to TradingView
Visit the [TradingView website](https://www.tradingview.com) or open the TradingView mobile app. Sign in using your credentials. If you don‚Äôt have an account, click ‚ÄúJoin Now‚Äù and create one using your email or social media login.

### Step 2: Access the Trading Panel
Once logged in, navigate to the **Trading Panel** at the bottom of the TradingView interface. This panel lists all supported brokers. If you don‚Äôt see the Trading Panel, open a chart by clicking ‚ÄúChart‚Äù in the top menu.

### Step 3: Select Exness
In the Trading Panel, scroll through the list of brokers or use the search bar to find **Exness**. Click the Exness logo to initiate the connection process.

### Step 4: Enter Exness Credentials
A pop-up window will prompt you to log in to your Exness account. Enter your Exness email and password. Double-check for accuracy to avoid connection issues. If your account requires two-factor authentication (2FA), have your authentication app or code ready.

### Step 5: Authorize the Connection
After entering your credentials, click ‚ÄúConnect‚Äù or ‚ÄúSign In.‚Äù TradingView will authenticate your Exness account. You may need to select your account type (e.g., Standard or Pro) and confirm trading preferences, such as leverage settings.

### Step 6: Test the Integration
Once connected, you‚Äôll see your Exness account details in the Trading Panel. Open a chart for a trading pair (e.g., EUR/USD or XAU/USD), and verify that you can place trades. Test with a demo account first to ensure everything works smoothly.

### Step 7: Customize Your TradingView Setup

## Alternative Integration via MetaTrader

If direct integration isn‚Äôt available for your Exness account type, you can use **MetaTrader 4 (MT4)** or **MetaTrader 5 (MT5)** as a bridge. Here‚Äôs how:

1. Download MT4/MT5 from the Exness website and log in with your Exness credentials.
2. On TradingView, use a third-party tool like **PineConnector** to sync TradingView alerts with MT4/MT5.
3. Set up alerts on TradingView for your trading signals, which PineConnector will execute on your Exness MT4/MT5 account.

This method is slightly more complex but effective for automating trades based on TradingView analysis.
