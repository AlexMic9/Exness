## Is Exness Available in Sweden?

Yes, Exness operates in Sweden and offers its trading services to Swedish traders. The broker provides access to a wide range of financial instruments, including forex, commodities, indices, stocks, and cryptocurrencies, through its user-friendly platforms. Swedish traders can open accounts, deposit funds, and trade seamlessly, benefiting from Exness‚Äôs global infrastructure tailored to local needs.

Exness does not have a specific registration with Sweden‚Äôs Financial Supervisory Authority (Finansinspektionen). However, it operates legally in Sweden under the European Union‚Äôs ‚Äúpassporting‚Äù system. This system allows brokers licensed in one EU member state to offer services across other EU countries, including Sweden, without needing local registration. Exness holds licenses from reputable regulators like the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the UK, ensuring compliance with EU regulations such as the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II).

## Regulatory Compliance and Safety for Swedish Traders

Sweden‚Äôs financial markets are overseen by Finansinspektionen, which enforces strict standards to protect investors and ensure market integrity. As part of the EU, Sweden adheres to MiFID II, which promotes transparency, fair practices, and investor protection. Exness complies with these regulations, making it a safe and reliable choice for Swedish traders.

Key safety features include:

- **Segregated Accounts**: Exness keeps client funds separate from its operational funds, ensuring that traders‚Äô deposits are protected in case of financial difficulties.
- **Negative Balance Protection**: This feature prevents traders from losing more than their initial deposit, which is crucial in volatile markets.
- **Regulatory Oversight**: Licenses from CySEC and FCA require Exness to adhere to high standards of financial integrity, including regular audits and transparent operations.

These measures align with Sweden‚Äôs emphasis on investor protection, giving traders confidence in Exness‚Äôs reliability.
