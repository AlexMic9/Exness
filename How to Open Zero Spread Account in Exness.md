## What Is a Zero Spread Account?

A Zero Spread Account is a trading account where the bid and ask prices for financial instruments are equal, resulting in **no spread**‚Äîthe difference between the buying and selling price. Instead of spreads, traders pay a fixed commission per trade, which provides greater cost transparency and predictability. This setup is ideal for strategies that rely on small price movements, such as scalping or day trading, as it minimizes transaction costs.

The Exness Zero Spread Account offers **zero spreads on the top 30 instruments** for 95% of the trading day, with low commissions starting from **$0.2 per side per lot**. It also features market execution, no requotes, and unlimited leverage (subject to conditions), making it a powerful tool for experienced traders.

## Why Choose the Exness Zero Spread Account?

Before diving into the account opening process, let‚Äôs explore why the Zero Spread Account is a compelling choice:

- **Cost Efficiency**: With zero spreads, traders avoid additional costs associated with spread fluctuations, especially during volatile market conditions. The fixed commission structure allows for precise cost calculations.
- **Transparent Pricing**: Commissions are clearly outlined, ensuring traders know exactly what they‚Äôll pay per trade.
- **Fast Execution**: The account offers rapid order execution, minimizing slippage and enabling traders to capitalize on quick market movements.
- **Diverse Instruments**: Traders can access forex pairs, commodities, indices, cryptocurrencies, and more, allowing for diversified strategies.
