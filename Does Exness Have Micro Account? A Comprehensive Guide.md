## What Is a Micro Account?

Before exploring Exness‚Äôs offerings, let‚Äôs clarify what a micro account is. A micro account is a type of trading account designed for beginners or traders with small capital. It allows trading in smaller lot sizes, typically micro-lots (1,000 units of the base currency), which reduces financial risk. Key features of micro accounts include:

- **Low Minimum Deposits**: Often as low as $1, making them accessible for new traders.
- **Small Trade Sizes**: Trading in micro-lots minimizes exposure to market volatility.
- **High Leverage Options**: Allows traders to control larger positions with less capital.
- **Practice-Friendly**: Ideal for testing strategies in a live market with minimal risk.

Micro accounts are perfect for those who want to dip their toes into forex trading without committing significant funds.

## Does Exness Have Micro Account?

While Exness doesn‚Äôt explicitly label it as a ‚Äúmicro account,‚Äù the Standard Cent Account functions similarly, catering to beginners and traders with limited capital. This account type allows trading in cent-based lots, meaning your trades are measured in cents rather than dollars, significantly reducing risk.

### Features of the Exness Standard Cent Account

- **Low Minimum Deposit**: You can start trading with as little as $10, depending on your region and payment method. This low barrier makes it accessible for beginners.
