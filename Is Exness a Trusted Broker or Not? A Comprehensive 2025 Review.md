## Regulatory Framework: Is Exness Legit?

Regulation is a cornerstone of a broker‚Äôs credibility. Exness operates under several regulatory bodies, ensuring compliance with financial standards in various regions:

- **Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)** ‚Äì UK: Exness (UK) Ltd is regulated by the FCA, a Tier-1 regulator with strict oversight.
- **Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC)** ‚Äì Cyprus: Exness‚Äôs Cyprus entity complies with EU financial regulations, offering investor protection.
- **Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA)** ‚Äì South Africa: Enhances Exness‚Äôs credibility in the African market.
