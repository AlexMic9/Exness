## What Is the Exness Zero Spread Account?

The Exness Zero Spread Account is a professional trading account designed for traders who seek minimal transaction costs. Unlike traditional accounts where brokers charge a spread (the difference between the bid and ask price), this account eliminates spreads on the top 30 trading instruments for most of the trading day. Instead, traders pay a fixed commission per trade, starting as low as $0.2 per side per lot, depending on the instrument and trading volume.

This account is particularly appealing to scalpers, day traders, and those employing high-frequency trading strategies, as it offers cost predictability and faster execution speeds. With a minimum deposit starting at $200 (which may vary by region), it‚Äôs accessible to both intermediate and advanced traders.

## Key Features of the Exness Zero Spread Account

### 1. Zero Spreads on Major Instruments
The standout feature of this account is the absence of spreads on major currency pairs, metals, and select cryptocurrencies for up to 95% of the trading session. This eliminates the cost fluctuations associated with spread widening during volatile market conditions, making it ideal for strategies that rely on precise entry and exit points.

### 2. Low and Transparent Commissions
Instead of spreads, Exness charges a commission per trade, which starts at $0.2 per side per lot. This fixed fee structure allows traders to calculate costs upfront, enhancing transparency and aiding in better trade planning.

### 3. Ultra-Fast Market Execution
The Zero Spread Account uses market execution, ensuring trades are executed at the current market price with no requotes. Exness claims execution speeds under 25 milliseconds, which is critical for traders capitalizing on small price movements.

### 4. High Leverage Options
Traders can access leverage up to 1:Unlimited, depending on their region and trading experience. While this allows control over larger positions with less capital, it also amplifies risks, requiring careful risk management.

### 5. Diverse Trading Instruments
The account supports trading in forex pairs, metals, cryptocurrencies, energies, stocks, and indices. This variety enables traders to diversify their portfolios and explore multiple markets.

### 6. Swap-Free Option
For Muslim traders, Exness offers a swap-free version of the Zero Spread Account, eliminating overnight interest charges in compliance with Sharia law.
