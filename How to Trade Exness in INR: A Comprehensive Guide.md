- **Fill in Your Details**: Provide your email address, phone number, and personal information. Ensure accuracy, as this will be verified later.
- **Choose INR as Your Currency**: During registration, select INR as your account‚Äôs base currency to avoid conversion fees.
- **Verify Your Identity**: Submit proof of identity (e.g., Aadhaar card, passport) and proof of residence (e.g., utility bill or bank statement). Indian traders may also need to provide their PAN card for tax compliance. Verification typically takes a few hours but may extend to 24 hours during high volumes.

### 2. Choose the Right Account Type

Exness offers various account types to suit different trading needs:

- **Standard Account**: Ideal for beginners, with no commission fees and stable spreads starting at 0.9 pips.

- **Zero Account**: Designed for high-frequency traders, featuring near-zero spreads on major pairs.
- **Raw Spread Account**: Offers the lowest spreads with a fixed commission per trade.

For most Indian traders, the Standard Account is a great starting point due to its low entry barrier and INR support.

### 3. Fund Your Account in INR

Once your account is verified, you can deposit funds. Exness supports multiple INR-compatible payment methods:

- **Bank Transfers**: Transfer INR directly from major Indian banks like HDFC, ICICI, or SBI. Processing typically takes 2-4 hours.
- **E-Wallets**: Use Skrill, Neteller, or Perfect Money for instant deposits.

3. Choose your preferred payment method and enter the amount.
4. Follow the prompts to complete the transaction.

Exness does not charge deposit fees, but check for any third-party charges from payment providers.

### 4. Download and Set Up a Trading Platform

Exness supports multiple platforms for trading:

- **MetaTrader 4/5**: Industry-standard platforms available for desktop, mobile, and web. Download MT4 or MT5 from the Exness website or app store.

After downloading, log in using your Exness credentials. Customize your workspace by selecting INR-based currency pairs (e.g., USD/INR, EUR/INR) and adding technical indicators like Moving Averages or Bollinger Bands for analysis.

### 5. Place Your First Trade

Before trading, familiarize yourself with the market and instruments available:

- **Forex Pairs**: Trade major pairs like USD/INR or EUR/INR for high liquidity and tighter spreads. Minor and exotic pairs offer higher volatility but wider spreads.
- **Commodities**: Trade gold, silver, or oil with low spreads.
- **Stocks and Indices**: Access CFDs on global stocks (e.g., Apple, Tesla) and indices (e.g., S&P 500).
- **Cryptocurrencies**: Trade Bitcoin and Ethereum 24/7 with swap-free options.

To place a trade:

1. Select a currency pair or instrument in your trading platform.
2. Analyze market conditions using technical or fundamental analysis.
3. Set your trade parameters (e.g., lot size, stop-loss, take-profit).
4. Execute the trade by clicking ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù or ‚ÄúSell.‚Äù

Start with a demo account to practice without risking real money. Exness‚Äôs Stop Out Protection feature helps prevent unexpected liquidations during volatile markets.

### 6. Manage Risks and Withdraw Profits

Effective risk management is crucial for long-term success:

- **Use Stop-Loss Orders**: Protect your capital by setting automatic exit points for losing trades.
- **Avoid Over-Leveraging**: High leverage (1:2000) can amplify profits but also losses. Start with conservative leverage.
- **Monitor Margin Levels**: Ensure your account has sufficient margin to avoid stop-outs.

To withdraw profits:

1. Go to the ‚ÄúWithdrawal‚Äù section in your Exness Personal Area.
2. Select your preferred method (e.g., bank transfer, UPI).
3. Enter the amount in INR and submit the request.
