## The Birthplace of Exness: Cyprus as the Heart of Operations

Exness was founded in 2008, and its roots are firmly planted in **Limassol, Cyprus**. The companyâ€™s headquarters are located at 1, Siafi Street, Porto Bello Business Center, Limassol 3042, Cyprus. This modern office serves as the central hub for Exnessâ€™s global operations, housing critical functions such as customer support, marketing, and administrative tasks. Cyprus, a Mediterranean island nation, is not just a scenic backdrop but a strategic location for Exnessâ€™s ambitions.

Why Cyprus? The country is renowned for its robust financial sector, favorable business environment, and well-established regulatory framework. As a member of the European Union, Cyprus offers access to European markets while maintaining a business-friendly tax regime. This makes it an ideal base for financial companies like Exness, which cater to a global clientele. The choice of Limassol, a thriving coastal city, further enhances Exnessâ€™s ability to attract talent and connect with traders across Europe, Asia, Africa, and beyond.

## The Founding Vision: A Blend of Finance and Technology

Exness was established by a group of professionals with expertise in finance and information technology. The key figures behind its inception were **Petr Valov** and **Igor Lychagov**, whose vision was to create a brokerage that prioritized transparency, accessibility, and technological innovation. Petr Valov, now the CEO, brought his programming and mathematical modeling skills to the table, laying the foundation for Exnessâ€™s advanced trading platforms. Igor Lychagov contributed financial expertise, ensuring the company adhered to sound risk management and client-centric policies.

From its early days, Exness aimed to address the gaps in the forex industry, such as lack of transparency and high trading costs. By leveraging proprietary algorithms and a client-first philosophy, Exness quickly gained traction. Today, it serves over 1 million active traders and boasts a monthly trading volume exceeding $4 trillion, a testament to its growth and reliability.

## A Cypriot Company with Global Ambitions

While Exness is a **Cypriot company** by origin, its reach extends far beyond the shores of Cyprus. The company operates in over 130 countries, offering trading services in forex, cryptocurrencies, stocks, commodities, indices, and metals. This global presence is supported by a network of offices across six continents, including strategic locations in Asia, Europe, Africa, and Latin America.

Exnessâ€™s international expansion began early in its journey. By 2012, the company had introduced MetaTrader 5, broadening its platform offerings. By 2014, its trading volume surpassed $180 billion, and in 2021, Exness became the first non-Japanese broker to achieve a monthly trading volume of $1 trillion. These milestones highlight Exnessâ€™s ability to scale rapidly while maintaining its commitment to competitive trading conditions.

In 2023, Exness marked a significant step in its global strategy by opening a new office in Uruguay, its first in Latin America. This move was strategic, targeting the regionâ€™s growing demand for forex trading and leveraging Uruguayâ€™s political stability and talent pool. The company also holds licenses from multiple regulatory bodies, including the **Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC)**, the **Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)** in the UK, and the **Financial Services Authority (FSA)** in Seychelles, ensuring compliance with international standards.

## The Exness Group: A Network of Regulated Entities

Exness operates as a group of companies under the Exness brand, each regulated by authorities in different jurisdictions. This structure allows Exness to cater to diverse markets while adhering to local regulations. Some of the key entities include:

## Why Cyprus Remains Central to Exnessâ€™s Identity

Cyprusâ€™s financial ecosystem, bolstered by institutions like CySEC, provides Exness with a stable and credible base. The countryâ€™s proximity to Europe, Asia, and the Middle East also facilitates Exnessâ€™s ability to serve a diverse clientele.

Moreover, Cyprusâ€™s reputation as a financial hub attracts top talent, which is crucial for a company like Exness that relies on innovation. The Limassol office is home to over 2,000 employees, including engineers, programmers, and financial experts, who work together to enhance the trading experience. The companyâ€™s tech stack, which includes tools like Apache Kafka, Cloudflare, and React, reflects its commitment to staying at the forefront of technology.

These features, combined with stop-out protection and negative balance protection, have earned Exness a loyal following. The companyâ€™s commitment to corporate social responsibility (CSR) further enhances its global reputation, with initiatives focused on education, community development, and environmental sustainability.

## Ownership and Privacy: A Privately Held Success Story

Exness is a **privately held company**, with ownership primarily in the hands of its founders, Petr Valov and Igor Lychagov, along with key executives and private investors. This private ownership structure allows Exness to focus on long-term goals rather than short-term shareholder demands. It also enables the company to innovate freely, investing in technology and client-centric features without external pressure.

While Exness maintains a level of confidentiality regarding its ownership details, this is not uncommon in the financial industry. Many brokerages prioritize privacy to protect their stakeholders from external pressures. What matters to traders is Exnessâ€™s track record: a 15-year history of growth, regulatory compliance, and client satisfaction.
