Before diving into the comparison, let’s briefly define these two account types:

### **Raw Spread Account**
The **Raw Spread Account** provides traders with direct access to interbank market prices, offering spreads as low as **0.0 pips** without any broker markup. Instead of profiting from spread markups, Exness charges a fixed commission of up to **$3.5 per side per lot**. This account is designed for traders who prioritize tight spreads, fast execution, and transparency in pricing.

### **Zero Account**
The **Zero Account** takes a different approach by offering **zero spreads** on the top 30 trading instruments for **95% of the trading day** and ultra-low spreads on other instruments. Like the Raw Spread Account, it operates on a commission-based model, with fees starting from **$0.2 per side per lot**, depending on the instrument. This account is ideal for traders who value predictability and minimal spread costs.

Both accounts fall under Exness’s **Professional Accounts** category, requiring a minimum deposit of **$200-$500** (depending on your region) and offering features like unlimited leverage, market execution, and no requotes. But how do they differ,'and which one is better for you? Let’s break it down.

## Raw Spread vs Zero Account: Key Differences

While both accounts offer low-cost trading environments, their differences lie in their spread structures, commission models, and suitability for specific trading styles. Here’s a detailed comparison:

### **1. Spread Structure**
- **Raw Spread Account**: Offers **floating spreads** starting from 0.0 pips, sourced directly from liquidity providers. Spreads can widen during volatile periods, such as news events or low liquidity.
- **Zero Account**: Provides **fixed zero spreads** on the top 30 instruments for 95% of the trading day, with floating spreads on other instruments. This ensures predictability but limits zero spreads to select pairs.

**Winner**: The Zero Account wins for traders who prioritize predictable zero spreads on major instruments, while the Raw Spread Account is better for those who want ultra-low spreads across a broader range of assets.

### **2. Commission Structure**
- **Raw Spread Account**: Charges a fixed commission of up to **$3.5 per side per lot** ($7 round trip), which is consistent across most instruments.
- **Zero Account**: Commissions start from **$0.2 per side per lot** but vary significantly by instrument (e.g., $35 round trip for EUR/USD). This can be lower or higher than the Raw Spread Account, depending on the pair.

**Winner**: The Zero Account has lower commissions for some instruments, making it more cost-effective for traders focusing on major pairs. However, the Raw Spread Account’s fixed commission is more predictable across all instruments.

### **3. Trading Costs**
To compare trading costs, let’s consider an example of trading **1 lot of EUR/USD** (round trip):

- **Raw Spread Account**:
  - Spread: ~0.1 pips (average) = ~$1
  - Commission: $7 (round trip)
  - **Total Cost**: ~$8
- **Zero Account**:
  - Spread: 0.0 pips = $0
  - Commission: $35 (round trip for EUR/USD)
  - **Total Cost**: $35

**Winner**: The Raw Spread Account is generally cheaper for most instruments, especially for traders who don’t focus exclusively on the top 30 pairs. The Zero Account is more cost-effective for high-volume traders on major pairs with low commissions.

### **4. Suitability for Trading Styles**
- **Raw Spread Account**: Ideal for **scalpers**, **day traders**, and **algorithmic traders** who need ultra-low spreads and don’t mind paying commissions. It’s also suitable for trading a wide range of instruments.
- **Zero Account**: Best for **scalpers** and **short-term swing traders** focusing on major forex pairs, where zero spreads and low commissions enhance profitability.

**Winner**: Depends on your strategy. The Raw Spread Account is more versatile, while the Zero Account excels for specific instruments and scalping.

### **5. Market Conditions**
- **Raw Spread Account**: Spreads can widen during volatile periods, which may increase costs for news traders or those active during low-liquidity hours.
- **Zero Account**: Zero spreads are maintained for most of the day on top instruments, offering stability even during moderate volatility.

**Winner**: The Zero Account is better for traders who want consistent pricing, especially during volatile market conditions.
