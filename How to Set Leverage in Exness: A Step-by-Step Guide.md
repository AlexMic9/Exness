## What Is Leverage in Forex Trading?

Leverage in forex trading is like a loan provided by your broker, enabling you to trade larger positions than your account balance allows. It‚Äôs expressed as a ratio, such as 1:100, 1:2000, or even 1:Unlimited in Exness. For example, with a 1:100 leverage, a $100 deposit lets you control a $10,000 position.

While leverage can amplify profits, it also increases the risk of significant losses. Exness offers a range of leverage options to suit both beginners and experienced traders, but understanding how to set and manage it is key to successful trading.

## Why Choose Exness for Leverage?

Exness stands out for its flexible leverage options, which can go as high as 1:Unlimited for certain accounts on the MT4 platform. This feature allows traders to open large positions with minimal margin, offering greater flexibility. However, unlimited leverage is best suited for experienced traders due to its high risk. Exness also provides dynamic leverage adjustments based on account equity and market conditions, ensuring a balance between opportunity and risk management.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Setting Leverage in Exness

Setting leverage in Exness is straightforward and can be done through your Personal Area (PA). Follow these steps to customize your leverage:

### Step 1: Log In to Your Exness Personal Area

Access your Exness account by logging into the Personal Area on the Exness website or mobile app. If you don‚Äôt have an account, register one at **[Open An Account](https://one.exnesstrack.org/boarding/sign-up/a/89rj8di4n7)** or **[Visit Brokers](https://one.exnesstrack.org/a/89rj8di4n7)**. Ensure your account is verified to unlock all features, including leverage adjustments.

### Step 2: Navigate to the ‚ÄúMy Accounts‚Äù Tab

Once logged in, go to the ‚ÄúMy Accounts‚Äù tab in your Personal Area. This section displays all your trading accounts, including their types (e.g., Standard, Pro, Raw Spread) and current settings.

### Step 3: Select the Trading Account

Click the three-dot icon next to the trading account you want to adjust. This will open the account settings menu. If you have multiple accounts, ensure you‚Äôre selecting the correct one, as leverage settings are account-specific.

### Step 4: Choose ‚ÄúChange Max Leverage‚Äù

From the settings menu, select ‚ÄúChange Max Leverage.‚Äù A dropdown menu will appear, showing available leverage options ranging from 1:2 to 1:Unlimited, depending on your account type and equity.

### Step 5: Set Your Desired Leverage

Choose a leverage level that aligns with your trading strategy and risk tolerance. You can also select ‚ÄúCustom‚Äù to input a specific ratio. Note that the maximum leverage available depends on your account‚Äôs equity and Exness‚Äôs margin requirements. For example:
- Accounts with higher equity may have access to higher leverage.
- During major economic news or holidays, leverage may be temporarily capped (e.g., 1:200).

### Step 6: Confirm Your Changes

After selecting your leverage, click ‚ÄúContinue‚Äù to confirm. Exness will apply the new leverage to your account, and you‚Äôll see the updated settings in the Personal Area. You can verify the actual leverage applied under the account details.

## Understanding Leverage Limits in Exness

Exness offers different leverage limits based on account types and trading platforms:
- **MT4 Accounts**: Standard, Standard Cent, Pro, Raw Spread, and Zero accounts can access up to 1:Unlimited leverage.
- **MT5 Accounts**: Leverage is capped at 1:2000 for all account types.
- **Kenyan Clients**: Maximum leverage is limited to 1:400 due to regulatory requirements.

Additionally, leverage may be dynamically adjusted in certain scenarios:
- **Economic News**: From 15 minutes before to 5 minutes after major news releases, leverage may be reduced to 1:200.
- **Weekends and Holidays**: From 19:00 GMT+0 on Friday to 23:00 GMT+0 on Sunday, leverage for new positions is capped at 1:200.

Always check the Economic Calendar in your Personal Area to stay informed about events that may affect leverage.

## Risks of High Leverage and How to Manage Them

While high leverage can boost profits, it also magnifies losses. For example, with 1:2000 leverage, a 0.05% market move against your position could wipe out your entire balance. To trade responsibly, consider these risk management tips:

### 1. Start with Lower Leverage
If you‚Äôre a beginner, opt for lower leverage (e.g., 1:50 or 1:100) to minimize risk while you learn the markets.

### 2. Use Stop-Loss Orders
Set stop-loss orders to automatically close positions at a predetermined loss level, protecting your capital.

### 3. Monitor Margin Levels
Exness issues a margin call at 60% margin level and a stop-out at 0%, closing positions if your margin is insufficient. Regularly check your margin level in the trading platform to avoid unexpected closures.

### 4. Practice on a Demo Account
Before using high leverage on a live account, practice on an Exness demo account to test strategies without risking real money.

### 5. Stay Informed
Keep an eye on market conditions and Exness notifications, as leverage changes during volatile periods can affect your trades.
