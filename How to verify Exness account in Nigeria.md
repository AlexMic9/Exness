Follow these steps to successfully verify your Exness account in Nigeria:

### Step 1: Log in to Your Exness Account
Visit the Exness website or open the Exness mobile app. Log in using your registered email address and password. If youâ€™re a new user, complete the registration process by providing your details and confirming your email or phone number.

### Step 2: Access the Verification Section
Once logged in:
- Navigate to the **Personal Area** (dashboard).
- Locate the **Verification** or **Profile Completion** section. This is usually found under your account settings or profile tab.
- Click on **Verify Account** to begin the process.

### Step 3: Submit Your Proof of Identity (POI)
Exness requires a valid identification document to confirm your identity:
- Select **Proof of Identity** from the verification menu.
- Choose the document type (e.g., International Passport, National ID, etc.).
- Upload a clear, high-quality scan or photo of the document. Ensure all details, including your name, date of birth, and ID number, are visible.
- If the document has two sides (e.g., National ID or Driverâ€™s License), upload both the front and back.

**Tips**:
- Use natural lighting to avoid shadows or glare.
- Ensure the file size meets Exnessâ€™ requirements (usually under 10MB).
- Acceptable formats include JPG, PNG, or PDF.

### Step 4: Submit Your Proof of Address (POA)
Next, verify your residential address:
- Select **Proof of Address** from the verification menu.
- Upload a document that clearly shows your name and address. Examples include a recent utility bill or bank statement.
- Ensure the document is dated within the last six months and matches the address provided during registration.

**Tips**:
- If you donâ€™t have a utility bill in your name, you can use a bank statement or a tenancy agreement.
- Black out sensitive information (e.g., bank account numbers) if needed, but keep your name and address visible.

### Step 5: Complete Economic Profile (Optional)
Exness may ask you to complete an **Economic Profile** to assess your trading experience and financial status. This step is often required for compliance:
- Answer questions about your income source, trading knowledge, and investment goals.
- Be honest, as this information helps Exness tailor services to your needs.

### Step 6: Submit and Wait for Approval
After uploading all documents:
- Double-check that all uploads are clear and meet Exnessâ€™ guidelines.
- Submit your verification request.
- Exness typically reviews documents within 24â€“48 hours. Youâ€™ll receive a notification via email or in your Personal Area once your account is verified.

### Step 7: Troubleshoot if Rejected
If your verification is rejected, Exness will provide a reason (e.g., unclear document, mismatched details). To resolve:
- Review the rejection notice in your Personal Area.
- Re-upload corrected or clearer documents.
- Contact Exness support via live chat, email, or phone if you need assistance.
